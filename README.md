# sql-challenge
##Background
In this repository, I pretend to be a new data engineer at 
Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My task was to complete a research 
project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. 
For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, 
imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data.
